            <p>Welcome to the Puzzle Challenge! Our puzzle challenge is designed to test and enhance your problem-solving skills through three levels of difficulty: Basic, Intermediate, and Hard. Each level offers a unique set of puzzles that will challenge your mind and creativity.</p>
            <h2>How It Works:</h2>
            <p>Basic Level: This level is open to all users. You can start solving puzzles right away to get a feel for the challenge.</p>
            <p>Intermediate and Hard Levels: To unlock these levels, you must pass a test. The test consists of 2 puzzles from the current level. For example, to move from Basic to Intermediate, you must solve 2 Basic level puzzles.</p>
            <p>Accessing Higher Levels: Once you pass the test, you'll gain access to the next level's puzzles. This ensures that you're prepared for the increased difficulty.</p>
            <h2>Tips for Success:</h2>
            <p>Try It Yourself First: While you can see the answer to a puzzle, we encourage you to attempt solving it on your own first. This will help you improve your problem-solving skills.</p>
            <p>Use the Reasoning: Each puzzle comes with a reasoning section that explains the answer. Use this to understand the logic behind the solution and improve your approach to similar puzzles in the future.</p>

            <h1>Level Based Puzzles</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the Puzzle Challenge! Our puzzle challenge is designed to test and enhance your problem-solving skills through three levels of difficulty: Basic, Intermediate, and Hard. Each level offers a unique set of puzzles that will challenge your mind and creativity.</p>
            <h2>How It Works:</h2>
            <p>Basic Level: This level is open to all users. You can start solving puzzles right away to get a feel for the challenge.</p>
            <p>Intermediate and Hard Levels: To unlock these levels, you must pass a test. The test consists of 2 puzzles from the current level. For example, to move from Basic to Intermediate, you must solve 2 Basic level puzzles.</p>
            <p>Accessing Higher Levels: Once you pass the test, you'll gain access to the next level's puzzles. This ensures that you're prepared for the increased difficulty.</p>
            <h2>Tips for Success:</h2>
            <p>Try It Yourself First: While you can see the answer to a puzzle, we encourage you to attempt solving it on your own first. This will help you improve your problem-solving skills.</p>
            <p>Use the Reasoning: Each puzzle comes with a reasoning section that explains the answer. Use this to understand the logic behind the solution and improve your approach to similar puzzles in the future.</p>
